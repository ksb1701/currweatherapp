This folder/repository has three main files and one folder.
One HTML file, one CSS file, one JavaScript file and one images folder.
The images folder has nine images.
If you want to use the project then you must copy all the three files and the folder in a single folder and then try to operate them.
Running into troubles is pretty rare but if you do, you can message me about the same.
Generally you might have forgotten to include the images folder.
